title: "A Beautiful Horizon"

Are the words that I write coming from my head?

or from the thoughts of someone that is  long dead

Do I just repeat the words that somebody said?

or delve deeper by doing some research

Am I on the shoulders of Giants?

or on their backs

Do I create works of art?

or works of replication

An intellectual epiphany? 

or a sudden remembrance

An unexpected striking truth?

or something I read from a book

A master creation?

or a master duplication

Am I holding the brush on this canvas that I paint?

or is someone else guiding the brush for me

I am just standing on top 

of a pile of humans

who gave their lives and their hearts

so we could see through the mirage
