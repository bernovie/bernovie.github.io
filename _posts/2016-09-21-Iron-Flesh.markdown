I am frozen to the bone, even better I have a frozen heart

An innocent man here wouldn’t last

Life or death a single movement can determine

If you want to survive there is no room for doubt

The snow paints the mountains a beautiful white

A brand new page for me to write

My sword be the pen, and blood be the ink

A deadly battle is about to begin

So get your battle-axes, swords and javelins

The Vikings are coming, but so are we

A battle scream, a man’s last sounds

As we run towards battle our minds become one

Thank you Lord for the gifts of the land

My loyalty is eternal, I won’t let you down

Cold iron pierces warm flesh

The rhythm of the fallen, the number of dead

A fellow man’s dying screams, I can’t keep out of my head

The once white snow is now turning red

The battle is over, the Anglo-Saxons have won

I have survived one more day to return with my son
